# Final-Year-Project
                    The process of analyzing the released results soon after the completion of semester examinations of B-Tech students by the institution is the most essential and substantial extravaganza. Either the class teacher or a HOD or a specific in charge of the institution has to spend more than a week in order to do so traditionally. Certain person is manually managing the things starting from entering the roll number of each and every student into the results portal of the JNTUA official website, gathering the data regarding the results of each student, making the computation of pass percentage of each student, number of backlogs that a particular student has, subject wise pass percentage analysis and so on. 
With the rapidly evolving Computer technology and automation methods using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, the entire process of results analysis can be facilitated in order to lessen the manpower.
Presently as technology is changing and the volume of automation in day to day life is gradually increasing. The improvisations aim at lessening the manpower, and increase trustworthiness, perfection, and provide less time consumption to endorse the result. Our project proposes and implements a simple and astonishing method based upon software that can be replaced with the conventional implementation and deals with upgrading the traditional approach to the automatic version as follows

•	A simple interface asks for the txt file containing list of hall ticket numbers of students of a batch and the link that should be specified in order to access the results. 
•	Using python web scraping, we are going to fetch the results of each and every student.
•	Results are analyzed accordingly.
•	Analyzed data should also be emailed to corresponding officials of the institution.

Hence offering decreased human stress and increasing perfection
